Harding earlier wrote a book about Edward Snowden which was a similar sham. Julian Assange called it \"a hack job in the purest sense of the term\". Harding is also known as plagiarizer.

       "6252  Even aside from its decade-long campaign against Assange, the Guardian is far from solid and reliable, as Greenwald claims. It has been at the forefront of the relentless, and unhinged, attacks on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn for prioritising the rights of Palestinians over Israels right to continue its belligerent occupation. Over the past three years, the Guardian has injected credibility into the Israel lobbys desperate efforts to tar Corbyn as an anti-semite                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "6263  Equally, the Guardian has made clear who its true heroes are. Certainly not Corbyn or Assange, who threaten to disrupt the entrenched neoliberal order that is hurtling us towards climate breakdown and economic collapse. Its pages, however, are readily available to the latest effort to prop up the status quo from Tony Blair, the man who led Britain, on false pretences, into the largest crime against humanity in living memory  the attack on Iraq                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "6268  That humanitarian intervention cost the lives of many hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and created a vacuum that destabilised much of the Middle East, sucked in Islamic jihadists like al-Qaeda and ISIS, and contributed to the migrant crisis in Europe that has fuelled the resurgence of the far-right. None of that is discussed in the Guardian or considered grounds for disqualifying Blair as an arbiter of what is good for Britain and the worlds future                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

He was taken apart in a Real News interview (vid) about the book. The interviewer pointed out that there is absolutely no evidence in the book to support its claims. When asked for any proof for his assertion Harding defensively says that he is just \"storytelling\" - in other words: it is fiction. Harding earlier wrote a book about Edward Snowden which was a similar sham. Julian Assange called it \"a hack job in the purest sense of the term\". Harding is also known as plagiarizer. When he worked in Moscow he copied stories and passages from the now defunct Exile, run by Matt Taibbi and Mark Ames. The Guardian had to publish an apology  "
